<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="chapter-26.-self-supervised-learning">Chapter 26. Self-supervised Learning</h3>
<p>Self-supervised learning is a type of unsupervised learning where the data itself provides the supervision. This approach leverages the inherent structure in the data to generate labels, enabling the model to learn useful representations without requiring labeled data. These representations can be used for various downstream tasks, such as classification, detection, and segmentation.</p>
<section id="pretext-tasks-in-computer-vision" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="pretext-tasks-in-computer-vision">26.1. Pretext Tasks in Computer Vision</h4>
<p>Pretext tasks are artificially created tasks that help a model learn useful representations of the data. These tasks do not require manually labeled data, as the labels can be derived from the data itself. The goal is to design tasks that encourage the model to learn features that are beneficial for downstream applications.</p>
</section>
<section id="rotation-prediction" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="rotation-prediction">26.1.1. Rotation Prediction</h4>
<p><strong>Rotation prediction</strong> involves training a model to predict the rotation applied to an image. By learning to recognize different rotations, the model gains a better understanding of the visual features in the image.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Task Definition:</strong> The model is given an image and a rotation (0°, 90°, 180°, 270°) applied to it, and it must predict the rotation angle.</li>
<li><strong>Learning Objective:</strong> By learning to predict the rotation, the model captures the spatial structure and orientation of objects within the image. This helps the model understand shapes, edges, and other spatial features.</li>
<li><strong>Advantages:</strong> Simple to implement and effective in learning spatial features. It can be easily applied to any dataset without needing manual annotation.</li>
<li><strong>Disadvantages:</strong> May not capture fine-grained features specific to certain tasks. The task might be too simple for complex datasets, potentially leading to underfitting.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> Consider an image dataset where each image is rotated by one of the four possible angles. The model is trained to classify the rotation angle of each image. This task forces the model to learn the orientation and spatial arrangement of objects within the images.</p>
</section>
<section id="jigsaw-puzzles" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="jigsaw-puzzles">26.1.2. Jigsaw Puzzles</h4>
<p><strong>Jigsaw puzzles</strong> involve training a model to solve shuffled pieces of an image. This task helps the model understand the spatial relationships and context within the image.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Task Definition:</strong> An image is divided into a grid of patches, which are then shuffled. The model must predict the correct arrangement of the patches.</li>
<li><strong>Learning Objective:</strong> By solving the jigsaw puzzle, the model learns to capture the global context and relationships between different parts of the image. This encourages the model to learn both local features (within patches) and global features (across patches).</li>
<li><strong>Advantages:</strong> Encourages the model to learn both local and global features. This task is versatile and can be adjusted in difficulty by changing the number of patches.</li>
<li><strong>Disadvantages:</strong> Requires careful design to balance difficulty and learning efficiency. If the task is too difficult, the model may struggle to learn; if too easy, it may not learn useful features.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> An image is divided into a 3x3 grid, resulting in 9 patches. These patches are shuffled, and the model is trained to predict the correct position of each patch. This helps the model learn the spatial dependencies and context within the image.</p>
</section>
<section id="colorization" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="colorization">26.1.3. Colorization</h4>
<p><strong>Colorization</strong> involves training a model to predict the color version of a grayscale image. This task helps the model learn to recognize objects and their context within the image.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Task Definition:</strong> The model is given a grayscale image and must predict the corresponding color image.</li>
<li><strong>Learning Objective:</strong> By learning to colorize images, the model captures the semantic information and color distributions within the image. It learns to associate grayscale patterns with specific colors, which requires understanding the content and context of the image.</li>
<li><strong>Advantages:</strong> Effective in learning semantic features and object recognition. Colorization can produce visually meaningful results that are easy to interpret.</li>
<li><strong>Disadvantages:</strong> Can be challenging to produce realistic colorizations, especially for complex scenes. The model may struggle with ambiguous cases where multiple colorizations are possible.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> The model is trained on a dataset of grayscale images with their corresponding color versions. The objective is to minimize the difference between the predicted color image and the ground truth color image, encouraging the model to learn semantic content and object boundaries.</p>
</section>
<section id="inpainting" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="inpainting">26.1.4. Inpainting</h4>
<p><strong>Inpainting</strong> involves training a model to fill in missing parts of an image. This task helps the model understand the context and structure of the image.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Task Definition:</strong> Portions of an image are masked, and the model must predict the missing pixels to reconstruct the complete image.</li>
<li><strong>Learning Objective:</strong> By learning to inpaint, the model captures the context and relationships between visible and missing parts of the image. It learns to infer missing information based on the surrounding context, which requires understanding the structure and content of the image.</li>
<li><strong>Advantages:</strong> Effective in learning contextual and structural features. Inpainting tasks can be easily adjusted in difficulty by varying the size and shape of the masked regions.</li>
<li><strong>Disadvantages:</strong> May struggle with complex scenes and large missing areas. The model may produce blurry or unrealistic completions if the task is too difficult.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> Random patches of an image are masked out, and the model is trained to predict the missing pixels. This forces the model to understand the context and structure of the image, learning to generate plausible completions.</p>

<section id="summary" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="summary">Summary</h3>
<p>By leveraging these pretext tasks, self-supervised learning in computer vision can produce robust models that learn useful representations without requiring labeled data. These representations can then be fine-tuned for various downstream tasks, such as object detection, segmentation, and classification. The key to effective self-supervised learning lies in designing pretext tasks that encourage the model to learn generalizable and transferable features.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Transformer Encoder:</strong> BERT uses the transformer architecture, specifically the encoder part, which processes input tokens with self-attention mechanisms.</li>
<li><strong>Token, Segment, and Position Embeddings:</strong> BERT uses these embeddings to capture different types of information about the input tokens.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Training Objective:</strong>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Masked Language Modeling (MLM):</strong> Randomly masks 15% of the tokens in the input and trains the model to predict these masked tokens. <span class="math display">\[
\mathcal{L}_{MLM} = -\sum_{i \in \text{masked tokens}} \log P(t_i | \text{context})
\]</span></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Next Sentence Prediction (NSP):</strong> BERT also includes a next sentence prediction task to improve the model’s understanding of sentence relationships. <span class="math display">\[
\mathcal{L}_{NSP} = -\log P(\text{IsNext} | \text{context}) - \log P(\text{NotNext} | \text{context})

<section id="data-distribution-and-structure" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="data-distribution-and-structure">26.10.1. Data Distribution and Structure</h4>
<p>Self-supervised learning relies on the assumption that the data contains intrinsic structures that can be exploited to learn meaningful representations. These structures are often captured through specific pretext tasks.</p>
<p><strong>Data Manifolds:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Theory:</strong> High-dimensional data often lie on lower-dimensional manifolds. SSL methods aim to learn representations that respect these manifolds, effectively reducing the dimensionality while preserving essential features.</li>
<li><strong>Applications:</strong> For instance, in image data, the pixel values do not vary independently but form complex structures and patterns (manifolds) that SSL methods can exploit.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Neighborhood Preservation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Theory:</strong> Many SSL methods, especially those based on contrastive learning, aim to preserve local neighborhoods in the learned representation space. This means that points close to each other in the original space should remain close in the representation space.</li>
<li><strong>Applications:</strong> Techniques like t-SNE and UMAP for visualizing high-dimensional data can be seen as neighborhood-preserving methods that can also inspire SSL algorithms.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Formal Definitions:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Data Manifold Hypothesis:</strong> The hypothesis that high-dimensional data can be approximated by a lower-dimensional manifold <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{M}\)</span> embedded in the high-dimensional space.</li>
<li><strong>Mathematical Formulation:</strong> If <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{x} \in \mathcal{M} \subset \mathbb{R}^D\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(f: \mathbb{R}^D \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^d\)</span> (with <span class="math inline">\(d \ll D\)</span>), then <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> should approximate the manifold structure such that <span class="math inline">\(f(\mathbf{x}) \approx \mathcal{M}\)</span>.</li>

<section id="mutual-information" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="mutual-information">26.10.2. Mutual Information</h4>
<p>Mutual information (MI) is a fundamental concept in SSL, measuring the amount of information shared between different views or parts of the data.</p>
<p><strong>Maximizing Mutual Information:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Theory:</strong> Many SSL methods aim to maximize the mutual information between different views of the data (e.g., different augmentations of the same image). This helps in learning representations that capture the underlying structure of the data.</li>
<li><strong>Applications:</strong> In contrastive learning, the goal is to maximize the mutual information between positive pairs (e.g., different views of the same image) while minimizing it for negative pairs (e.g., different images).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Mathematical Formulation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Mutual Information:</strong> For two random variables <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>, <span class="math display">\[
I(X; Y) = \int \int p(x, y) \log \frac{p(x, y)}{p(x)p(y)} \, dx \, dy
\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(p(x, y)\)</span> is the joint probability distribution of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(p(x)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(p(y)\)</span> are their marginal distributions.</li>
<li><strong>Contrastive Learning Objective:</strong> To maximize <span class="math inline">\(I(X; Y)\)</span> in practice, a lower-bound approximation such as the InfoNCE loss is often used: <span class="math display">\[
\mathcal{L}_{\text{contrastive}} = -\sum_{i} \log \frac{\exp(\text{sim}(\mathbf{z}_i, \mathbf{z}_i^+)/\tau)}{\sum_{j} \exp(\text{sim}(\mathbf{z}_i, \mathbf{z}_j^-)/\tau)}
\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\text{sim}(\cdot, \cdot)\)</span> denotes similarity (e.g., cosine similarity) between vectors, <span class="math inline">\(\tau\)</span> is a temperature parameter, <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{z}_i\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{z}_i^+\)</span> are positive pairs, and <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{z}_j^-\)</span> are negative pairs.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Theoretical Insights:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Data Processing Inequality:</strong> This principle states that any processing of the data cannot increase mutual information. Formally, if <span class="math inline">\(X \rightarrow Y \rightarrow Z\)</span>, then <span class="math inline">\(I(X; Z) \leq I(X; Y)\)</span>. This is important for understanding the limits of how much information can be captured by SSL methods.</li>
<li><strong>Mutual Information Maximization:</strong> By maximizing mutual information between different views, SSL methods ensure that the learned representations capture as much relevant information as possible.</li>
</ul>

<li><strong>Representation Learning:</strong> SSL methods aim to learn representations that capture essential features of the data, facilitating transfer to new tasks.</li>
<li><strong>Task Transferability:</strong> The degree to which a representation learned on one task (e.g., image rotation prediction) can be transferred to another task (e.g., object classification).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Theoretical Bounds:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Generalization Bounds:</strong> Theoretical bounds on generalization performance can be derived based on the properties of the SSL method and the data distribution. <span class="math display">\[
\mathbb{E}[L(f)] \leq \hat{L}(f) + \mathcal{O}\left(\sqrt{\frac{\log(1/\delta)}{2n}}\right)

</ul>
<p><strong>PAC-Bayesian Theory:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>PAC-Bayesian Bounds:</strong> Provide a framework for analyzing the generalization performance of SSL methods by considering the trade-off between the complexity of the learned representations and their fit to the data. <span class="math display">\[
\mathbb{E}[L(f)] \leq \hat{L}(f) + \frac{\text{KL}(Q \| P) + \log(\frac{2\sqrt{n}}{\delta})}{\sqrt{2n}}

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="inductive-biases">26.10.4. Inductive Biases</h4>
<p>Inductive biases are assumptions built into the learning algorithm to guide the learning process. In SSL, these biases often come from the choice of pretext tasks and network architectures.</p>
<p><strong>Example Biases:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Spatial Coherence:</strong> Many SSL methods for images assume that nearby pixels or patches are related (e.g., jigsaw puzzles, inpainting).</li>
<li><strong>Temporal Consistency:</strong> In speech and video data, SSL methods assume temporal consistency, leveraging the sequential nature of the data (e.g., future frame prediction in CPC).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Formal Definitions:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Inductive Bias:</strong> Any set of assumptions that a learning algorithm uses to predict outputs given inputs that it has not encountered before.</li>
<li><strong>Role in SSL:</strong> Inductive biases in SSL help the model leverage the structure of the data to learn more effectively. For example, the assumption that nearby patches in an image are likely to be similar helps models learn spatial coherence.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="theoretical-guarantees" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="theoretical-guarantees">26.10.5. Theoretical Guarantees</h4>
<p>Certain SSL methods come with theoretical guarantees, providing bounds on their performance and convergence.</p>
<p><strong>Example Techniques:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Contrastive Learning:</strong> Provides guarantees on representation quality by linking mutual information maximization to the quality of learned features.</li>
<li><strong>Information Bottleneck:</strong> The Information Bottleneck (IB) principle can be applied to SSL to ensure that the learned representations capture relevant information while discarding noise. <span class="math display">\[
\mathcal{L}_{\text{IB}} = I(X; Z) - \beta I(Z; Y)
\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(Z\)</span> is the learned representation, <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> is the input, and <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> is the target.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Convergence Analysis:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Theoretical Convergence:</strong> Studies on the convergence of SSL methods aim to provide conditions under which these methods are guaranteed to converge to a good solution.</li>
<li><strong>Example Result:</strong> For contrastive learning, under certain conditions, it can be shown that the optimization problem will converge to a representation that maximizes mutual information.</li>
